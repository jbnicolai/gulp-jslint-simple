# [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)-[jslint](http://www.jslint.com/)-simple

> Run JSLint analysis

How is this package different from other JSLint runners?

- No dependencies (other than [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)), contains a copy of the latest [JSLINT implementation](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint/blob/master/jslint.js) by [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/)
- Compatible with [JSHint reporters](https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=jshint%20reporter)


## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev gulp-jslint-simple
```


## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var jslint = require('gulp-jslint-simple');

gulp.task('lint', function () {
    gulp.src('*.js')
        .pipe(jslint.run())
        .pipe(jslint.report());
});
```


## API

Assuming:

```js
var jslint = require('gulp-jslint-simple');
```

### `jslint.run([options])`

Creates a transform stream that expects [Vinyl File](https://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl#file) objects in buffer mode (stream and null-contents modes are not supported) as input. The stream passes each incoming file object to the output unchanged. Each incoming object will be analyzed using latest JSLint. If analysis fails, a property `jslint` will be added to the object. A property `jshint` pointining to `jslint` will also be added for compatiblity with JSHint reporters.

#### options

_Type_: Object  
_Default_: no options

Options to pass through to `JSLINT` function. Allows overriding default JSLint flags on a project level (flags can then be overridden again at a file level using `/*jslint*/` comments).

#### options.includeData

_Type_: Boolean  
_Default_: false

If true, `jslint` property is added even when analysis succeeds. Additionally, `jslint.data` property is populated with `JSLINT.data()` object that contains analysis details.


### `jslint.report([options])`

Creates a transform stream that expects [Vinyl File](https://github.com/wearefractal/vinyl#file) objects as input. The stream passes each incoming file object to the output unchanged. Each incoming object that contains a file that failed JSLint analysis will be reported using `options.reporter`.

#### options

_Type_: Object  
_Default_: no options

Control report behaviour.

#### options.reporter

_Type_: Function  
_Default_: jslint.report.defaultReporter

Reporter to use to report errors for files that failed JSLint analysis.

#### options.emitError

_Type_: Boolean  
_Default_: false

If true, `jslint.report` will emit an `error` event on its output after reporting errors for the first file that failed JSLint analysis.


### `jslint.report.defaultReporter(results, data, options)`

JSHint-reporter-compatible function that prints formatted message for each specified error result. File, line and row specification is printed in format that is recognized by many editors and tools (clicking the file specification in such tools will open the specified file for editing at the specified location). Example output:
